In the 1970s, about 15 percent of the U.S. population was foreign-born. In the 1980s, the foreign-born proportion rose to about 20 percent. In",

This means that the sound waves reach your ear much faster than the sound waves reaching your ear from the guitar.

The war pitted the Central Powers\u2014including Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire\u2014against the Allies\u2014including France, Russia, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilized in one of the largest wars in history. More than 9 million combatants were killed, largely because of great technological advances in firepower without corresponding advances in mobility. It was the second deadliest conflict in history, preceded only by the Mongol invasions and T",
            "The territorial disputes between the major powers in Europe in 1914 can be traced back to the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The congress created the Concert of Europe, which was a group of four major powers (Austria, Prussia, Russia, and the United Kingdom) that met to resolve disputes among the European powers. The Concert of Europe worked until the Crimean War in 1854, when Russia's defeat revealed its weakness as a military power. The European powers began to realize that the Concert of Europe was not effective in maintaining peace in Europe. The territorial disputes that arose after the Crimean War were not resolved by the Congress of Vienna."
