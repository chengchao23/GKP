In humans, the muscles used for breathing are largely inactive, and breathing takes place entirely by the rib cage expanding and contracting to allow air to enter and leave the lungs. Dolphins, however, have a muscle called the diaphragm that is active when they breathe, and so they can both breathe and pump water through their blowhole at the same time.",
            "Dolphins have lungs and breathe air; they are mammals. The lungs of dolphins are adapted to their aquatic lifestyle, so they are not able to breathe air in the way humans do on land. Dolphins breathe through a blowhole on top of their head, which is closed when underwater. To breathe, a dolphin must be near the surface of the water or have its blowhole exposed to the air while swimming on the surface.",
            "Dolphins have evolved to be able to survive and thrive in the water. Their bodies have adapted to be streamlined and hydrodynamic.",
            "Dolphins have lungs and breathe air; they are mammals. However, they do have a layer of insulating blubber, and they can store oxygen in their blood. Both of these adaptations allow them to stay submerged for long periods of time."
